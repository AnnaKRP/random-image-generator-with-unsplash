# Random Image Generator With Unsplash

<p align="justify">
This web app allows users to view random, high-quality images from the Unsplash API. Each time the page loads or the refresh button is clicked, a new image is fetched from Unsplash's vast collection of stunning photography. 
The app also displays the image creator's name and the total likes theyâ€™ve received. 
Clicking on the image or the creator's name takes users directly to the source on Unsplash, providing an interactive experience to explore more works by the photographer.
